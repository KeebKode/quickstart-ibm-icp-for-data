## IBM Cloud Pak for Data on AWS

This Quick Start automatically deploys a multi-master, production instance of IBM Cloud Pak for Data into a new virtual private cloud (VPC) on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. A standard deployment takes about 3 hours, and a high availability (HA) deployment takes about 4 hours. 

IBM Cloud Pak for Data is an analytics platform that helps you prepare your data for artificial intelligence (AI). 

IBM Cloud Pak for Data can use AWS services and features, including VPCs, Availability Zones, security groups, Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) storage, and Elastic Load Balancing to build a reliable and scalable cloud platform.

This Quick Start is for enterprise users who want to connect, catalog, govern, transform, and analyze data, regardless of where the data is.
